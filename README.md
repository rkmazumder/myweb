Professional website for Sarah Jane Schmidt: <a href='http://sarahjaneschmidt.com'>www.sarahjaneschmidt.com</a>.

Based off of the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). I also wrote a short description of how I got the site working [here](http://sarahjaneschmidt.com/blog/2019/how-site/), and found [this site](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58) the most useful description of how to get my custom domain working (I manage it through google domains).

The theme I use includes a script that builds the site offline and then pushes the final product here. This means that if you're looking for the actual files I edit, they are offline somehwere. If you have an interest in looking at those, let me know and I'll figure out how to make it happen.
