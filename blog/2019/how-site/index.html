  <article class="post-content">
    <p>My old website was actually hosted on the blogger platform, and over the five years it was up I got pretty tired of my dated headshot and the clunky tools. I decided it was time to move to github hosting and then took a rather twisty, rambling path that ended here. I’ve decided to put together a short guide in case you’d like to make your own site with less confusion than I did.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I used ruby, blender, jekyll, a pre-made theme, github, and discovered I’m the only one left who still uses a c shell.</p>

<p>I’ve only worked on pages using html before, but I knew I wanted something a little fancier for my site. I was browsing themes that should interface with github and I ended up on a <a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/free/">jekyll themes page</a> where I fell pretty hard for <a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/al-folio/">al-folio</a>, a template specifically designed for academics complete with project pages and a publications page automatically constructed from a bib file. I was sold.</p>

<h4 id="but-whats-jekyll">But what’s <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>?</h4>

<p>From what I understand, it’s a tool that takes a set of input style files and pages with content in markdown and translates them to a website. Specifically, it’s meant for static websites rather than dynamic ones (I didn’t realize that was a thing, but apparently I’m not a web designer), and it’s integrated pretty well into github.</p>

<p>I started by installing a bunch of things, but I should have started by <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo">forking the template</a> to create a branch on my own github repository, renaming it to sjschmidt.github.io (or, in your case, username.github.io , and then <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository">cloning it</a> to a local directory.</p>

<h4 id="installing-software-in-circles">Installing software in circles</h4>

<p>Many places on the internet reccomended that I manage jekyll through a combination of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby</a> and <a href="https://bundler.io/">bundler</a>, two things that I had barely heard of before. Ruby is a high level programming language that is often used in web development (I think). Bundler helps to manage Ruby packages (known as gems). I relied on <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">this guide</a> for a lot of my basics, but I had to deviate from it in some rather strong ways.</p>

<p>Running a mac for astro, I already had <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> and its command line tools installed, so that’s first on the list.</p>

<p>Next is ruby. Most macs come with Ruby pre-installed (and mine had a relatively updated version) but I chased my own tail with the next few steps for a while because it was both not updated enough and giving me weird permission issues (I kept on being all like “I am ROOT!!!” and it wasn’t listening).</p>

<p>So make like <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/blog/how-to-install-ruby-on-a-mac-with-chruby-rbenv-or-rvm">this tutortial</a> and use your version of ruby to install <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew</a> to install ruby. And, if, like me, you’re running a c-shell because that’s how your computer was set up a decade ago and you set up your new ones the same way, just type bash to switch over and run the install commands.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-the-website">Back to the website</h4>

<p>Remember that? So at that point I went back to the directions on the jekyll tutorial or the jekyll theme instructions and run the bundle install command, followed by bundle exec jekyll serve. That creates a copy of your website at <a href="http://localhost:4000">localhost:4000</a> that you can reload and check out while you tweak settings and put together content.</p>

<p>As an aside, I spend a while banging my head against the wall with a <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/issues/270#issuecomment-56056606">bug like this one</a>, where it wouldn’t compile because of an invalid ASCII character, and I thought the solution wouldn’t work for me because of a bash vs. c shell issue. I eventually translated those commands and got going.</p>

<p>So after taking the time to git add and git commit all of your lovely changes, time to deploy. My template came with a handy script that replaced the other deployment (it does a fancy little extra branch so it only pushes the final website to github) but from there it was smooth sailing… except for all those changes I forgot to commit that one time. Just that one time.</p>
